🏙️ USCities House Prices – PAI 2025-2026
📖 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an interactive web application for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing real estate market trends in the 50 largest cities in the United States.
Using a dataset from Kaggle, the app combines data science, geospatial visualization, and machine learning to deliver a complete analytical tool for the U.S. housing market.

🎯 Objectives

Explore housing data interactively through filters and sortable tables.

Visualize properties on an interactive map using geographic data.

Analyze correlations between real estate prices and socio-economic indicators such as median income, population density, and city size.

Highlight regional disparities across metropolitan areas.

Include a price prediction module using machine learning models.

🧠 Key Features
Module	Description
Exploration	Browse and filter listings by price, surface, number of rooms, or city.
Cartography	Display properties on an interactive map (GeoPandas, Folium, Plotly).
Correlations	Interactive charts (scatterplots, heatmaps) to explore relationships between variables.
Prediction	Estimate property prices using a trained ML model.
Statistics	Compute summary indicators (average price per city, ZIP code, or income range).
Export	Download filtered data and visualizations (CSV, PNG).
